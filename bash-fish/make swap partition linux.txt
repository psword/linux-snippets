A) To add a swap partition (assuming /dev/sdb2 is the swap partition you want to add):

1. The hard drive can not be in use (partitions can not be mounted, and swap space can not be enabled). The easiest way to achieve this it to boot your system in rescue mode. Refer to Chapter 8 for instructions on booting into rescue mode. When prompted to mount the filesystem, select Skip.

Alternately, if the drive does not contain any partitions in use, you can unmount them and turn off all the swap space on the hard drive with the swapoff command.

2. Create the swap partition using parted or fdisk. Using parted is easier than fdisk; thus, only parted will be explained. To create a swap partition with parted:

* At a shell prompt as root, type the command parted /dev/sdb, where /dev/sdb is the device name for the hard drive with free space.

* At the (parted) prompt, type print to view the existing partitions and the amount of free space. The start and end values are in megabytes. Determine how much free space is on the hard drive and how much you want to allocate for a new swap partition.

* At the (parted) prompt, type mkpart <part-type> linux-swap <start> <end>, where <part-type> is one of primary, extended, or logical, start is the starting point of the partition, and end is the end point of the partition.

Changes take place immediately; be careful when you type.

* Exit parted by typing quit.

3. Now that you have the swap partition, use the command mkswap to setup the swap partition. At a shell prompt as root, type the following:

mkswap /dev/sdb2

4. To enable the swap partition immediately, type the following command:

swapon /dev/sdb2

5. To enable it at boot time, edit /etc/fstab to include:

/dev/sdb2 swap swap defaults 0 0

The next time the system boots, it will autoatically use the new swap partition.

6. After adding the new swap partition and enabling it, make sure it is enabled by viewing the output of the command cat /proc/swaps or free.
